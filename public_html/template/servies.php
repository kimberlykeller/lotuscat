						These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,
						to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize
						the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a
						protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator
						coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

						Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in
						magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced
						communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness
						has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could
						cross in the given time.

						We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering
						by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive
						me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal
						energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

						Resistance is futile.
